              <p>Hey there! üôå</p>
              <p>
                Already big hands for you that you have clicked on the
                "Support me" link in the navigation bar! This basically means
                that you think about supporting a developer contributing to
                the open-source community. So thanks already for this!
              </p>
              <p>
                My main goal when working on software packages is to
                open-source it in some way in the future. Sometimes it takes a
                lot of time and concept, but in the end this is the goal.
                Firstly, because making them available to others makes them
                better in the end. Secondly, I'm using a lot of open-source
                packages for my end-user projects, so I kind of believe in
                this ecosystem ‚ù§Ô∏è.

          <p>
            Besides putting the packages online, I am very keen on
            actively&nbsp;
            <em>maintaining</em>&nbsp;them over time. There are a lot of great
            tools available for free, but a lot are outdated, which is a pity.
            So one of my principles is to have all packages continuously
            integrated and automatically tested. Also, I'm using&nbsp;
