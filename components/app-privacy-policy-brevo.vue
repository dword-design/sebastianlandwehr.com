  <h2>Sending emails via Brevo</h2>
  <p>
    We use <strong>Brevo (formerly Sendinblue)</strong>, operated by Sendinblue
    GmbH, Köpenicker Straße 126, 10179 Berlin, Germany, for sending emails.
  </p>

  <p>This includes in particular:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Feedback communication</strong> (e.g., confirmation that feedback
      has been received, or our reply to it).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    For this purpose, the data required for delivery (e.g., email address,
    message content) is transmitted to Brevo and processed on servers located
    within the EU. Brevo processes this data solely for sending and evaluating
    the emails on our behalf.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have concluded a Data Processing Agreement with Brevo pursuant to Art. 28
    GDPR.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Legal basis:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      For feedback communication: Art. 6 (1) lit. b GDPR (performance of a
      contract) or Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR (our legitimate interest in efficient
      user communication).
    </li>
  </ul>
